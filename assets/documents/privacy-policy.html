    <h1>ZenShift Coach Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 20, 2025</p>

    <p>ZenShift Coach ("ZenShift," "we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the ZenShift mobile application collects, how we use it, and the choices you have when using the app on iOS and Android. Our goal is to keep everything simple: the app works offline, your data stays on your device, and you decide when to delete it.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Data you choose to provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meditation preferences and settings.</strong> When you adjust items such as preferred categories, difficulty, audio quality, haptics, notification toggles, theme, or weekly goals, the app saves those selections to local storage so your experience stays personalized across sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Favorites and saved content.</strong> Marking a session as a favorite stores its identifier and the time it was updated so we can show your starred meditations quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Reset confirmations.</strong> If you ask the app to reset your profile, we confirm the request before clearing the locally stored stats, history, and favorites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data created as you use the app</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Session history and progress.</strong> Each time you listen, we record the session ID, timestamps, completion status, progress, listening time, attempt count, and last playback position to help you resume, compute streaks, and show accurate stats—all stored locally with AsyncStorage.</li>
      <li><strong>Recommendation signals.</strong> To improve intent-based suggestions, we log anonymized usage patterns—selected context chips, durations, time of day, completion flag, and optional satisfaction rating—and maintain on-device analytics such as match confidence, tap counts, and empty-state frequency.</li>
      <li><strong>Free-text "expressed needs."</strong> If you type how you're feeling, we apply that text in memory to shape recommendations; the raw text is not persisted after the prediction finishes.</li>
      <li><strong>Device compatibility details.</strong> ZenShift reads the platform, OS version, device type, and feature support (e.g., haptics, push capabilities) solely to adjust UI and audio behavior on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment identifiers.</strong> For on-device A/B experiments, the app generates a random user identifier, stores variant assignments, and records metrics locally; no assignment data leaves the device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information only to run and improve ZenShift:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver personalized meditations, remember your preferences, resume playback, and calculate progress insights such as totals, streaks, and category stats.</li>
      <li>Generate and refine context-aware recommendations and measure their effectiveness through local analytics and lightweight experiments.</li>
      <li>Ensure the app performs well on your specific device model and OS version.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not use your data for advertising or sell it to third parties.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local-only storage.</strong> ZenShift stores all app data with Expo's AsyncStorage on your device. Nothing is uploaded to ZenShift servers or third-party clouds.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention.</strong> Data remains on your device until you reset it within the Profile screen or uninstall the app, both of which permanently delete the local records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
    <p>ZenShift does not sell, rent, or share personal data with marketers or analytics vendors. Because all data stays on your device, no cross-border transfers occur. We would disclose information only if legally required (e.g., to comply with a court order).</p>

    <h2>5. Your Controls and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manage preferences.</strong> Update meditation settings or favorites at any time; the changes immediately overwrite the previous local values.</li>
      <li><strong>Review progress.</strong> The Profile and history views present the stats and session records stored on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete data.</strong> Use the "Reset Profile Data" action or uninstall the app to clear all stored information.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt out of experiments.</strong> Because experiments rely on local assignments, clearing the profile resets any A/B test identifiers and metrics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ZenShift is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us so we can help remove it.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as ZenShift evolves. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date above and highlight material changes within the app.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about privacy, reach out anytime:</p>
