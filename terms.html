      <h2>18. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>

      <h3>Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at zenshift-support@onepingfanventure.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days of submission, you or we may bring a formal proceeding.
      </p>

      <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>YOU AND ONE PING FAN VENTURE LLC AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or our service shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration will be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted in English</li>
        <li>Held in Delaware or conducted remotely via video conference</li>
        <li>Decided by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with AAA rules</li>
        <li>Subject to the Federal Arbitration Act</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>YOU AND ONE PING FAN VENTURE LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.
      </p>

      <h3>Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>YOU AND ONE PING FAN VENTURE LLC WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.</strong> You and we are instead electing that all disputes be resolved through arbitration.
      </p>

      <h3>Exceptions</h3>
      <p>
        The following disputes are exceptions to the arbitration agreement:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any disputes seeking to enforce or protect intellectual property rights</li>
        <li>Any claim for injunctive relief</li>
        <li>Disputes that qualify for small claims court (up to $10,000)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Arbitration Costs</h3>
      <p>
        Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that your claim is frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for our attorney's fees and costs.
      </p>

      <h3>Opt-Out Right</h3>
      <p>
        You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice within 30 days of first accepting these Terms to: Arbitration Opt-Out, One Ping Fan Venture LLC, zenshift-support@onepingfanventure.com
