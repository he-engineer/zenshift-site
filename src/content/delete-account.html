    <div class="delete-section" id="what-retained">
      <h2>4. What Data Is Retained</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>No data is retained after account deletion.</strong> All personal and usage information is permanently removed from our systems and your device. Once deleted, your account cannot be recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ZenShift app stores data locally on your device using encrypted storage. When you delete your account through the app, this local data is wiped from your device's storage.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="delete-section" id="immediate-deletion">
      <h2>5. Immediate Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Your data is deleted immediately upon account deletion.</strong> There is no waiting period or processing delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you confirm account deletion in the app:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All data is instantly removed from your device's local storage</li>
        <li>Your account is immediately deactivated</li>
        <li>No further data is retained or processed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This instant deletion reflects our privacy-first design philosophy. Because the app primarily stores data locally on your device rather than on remote servers, deletion is immediate and complete.
